# Memory Cards Game

You can test the game here: [https://alban-care.github.io/memory-cards-game/](https://alban-care.github.io/memory-cards-game/)

## Rules of the game

The game consists of 16 cards, 8 pairs of cards in beginner mode (36 cards in intermediate mode and 64 in expert mode). The cards are placed face down and the player must find matching pairs by turning over the cards 2 at a time. If the cards match, they are deleted. If they don't match, they are returned. The game ends when all pairs have been found.

## Pokemon images

This folder contains all the images of the Pokemon used in my project.

This images come from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Please, do not modify this images or use them for other purposes.

If you want to keep the images with a CDN, you can use the following URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/{id}.png` where `{id}` is the id of the Pokemon or used the PokeAPI.

During the development of my project to not overload the PokeAPI, I will use the images from the jsdelivr CDN directly from my repository. When I finish the project, I will use the images directly from the PokeAPI.

I used the [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN to host the images. I used the following URL: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{username}/{repository}/images/{id}.png` where `{username}` is my GitHub username, `{repository}` is the name of the repository and `{id}` is the id of the Pokemon.

example: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alban-care/games/memory-cards/images/1.png`
